 Here is an explanation of the code

1. `using System;`: This line includes the `System` namespace, which contains fundamental classes and base classes that define commonly-used value and reference data types, events, and event handlers.

3. `namespace RecipeApp`: This line declares a namespace named `RecipeApp`, which organizes the code into a logical group. 

5. `class Recipe`: This line defines a class named `Recipe`, which will be used to create recipe objects.

7. `private string[] ingredients;`: This line declares a private string array named `ingredients` to store the list of ingredients for the recipe.

8. `private string[] steps;`: This line declares a private string array named `steps` to store the list of steps for the recipe.

10. `public Recipe(int numIngredients, int numSteps)`: This line defines a constructor for the `Recipe` class that takes two parameters: `numIngredients` and `numSteps`. It initializes the `ingredients` and `steps` arrays with the specified sizes.

14. `public void AddIngredient(int index, string ingredient)`: This line defines a method named `AddIngredient` that adds an ingredient to the `ingredients` array at the specified index.

18. `public void AddStep(int index, string step)`: This line defines a method named `AddStep` that adds a step to the `steps` array at the specified index.

22. `public void DisplayRecipe()`: This line defines a method named `DisplayRecipe` that displays the full recipe, including ingredients and steps, on the console.

27. `public void ScaleRecipe(double factor)`: This line defines a method named `ScaleRecipe` that scales the recipe by a specified factor. It updates the quantities of ingredients based on the scaling factor.

44. `static void Main(string[] args)`: This line is the entry point of the program. It defines the `Main` method, which is called when the program starts.

48. `Recipe recipe = new Recipe(numIngredients, numSteps);`: This line creates a new `Recipe` object with the specified number of ingredients and steps.

54. `Console.WriteLine("Enter the number of ingredients:");`: This line prompts the user to enter the number of ingredients.

59. `recipe.AddIngredient(i, Console.ReadLine());`: This line adds each ingredient entered by the user to the recipe object.

65. `recipe.AddStep(i, Console.ReadLine());`: This line adds each step entered by the user to the recipe object.

71. `recipe.DisplayRecipe();`: This line displays the original recipe on the console.

75. `double factor = double.Parse(Console.ReadLine());`: This line prompts the user to enter a scaling factor for the recipe.

79. `recipe.ScaleRecipe(factor);`: This line scales the recipe by the factor entered by the user.

83. `recipe.DisplayRecipe();`: This line displays the scaled recipe on the console.
